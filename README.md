### Project composition 🗃️  

[Art] - All 3D model made by me  
[Audio] - From Pixabay and OVANI sound (free/bought assets)  
[Plugins] - Plugins from the Unity Asset Store, mostly used during prototyping  
[butler] - This is normally a separate project that I add as a submodule to every Unity project, but it's added directly for simplicitys sake  
  
### Installation 🛠️  
  
Download the zip file that's appropriate for your operating system.   
Double-click the downloaded zip file to open it in your file explorer or zip program (e.g., WinZip, WinRAR).   
Right-click in the middle of the opened window and select "Extract All".   
Choose an installation location of your choice.   
Finally, run the game from the folder you extracted it to.   
  
### Notes 📝  
  
The game is build inside a single scene because I wanted the level to show in the main menu aswell.  
Many of the views aren't made into prefabs since there's ever only 1 copy of them in the game and there's only one developer working on the project, so merge conflicts are not an issue.
